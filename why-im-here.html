                Fresh out of high school I enrolled at The Art Institute of Pittsburgh pursuing a degree in Interactive Media and Design.
                Upon graduation I landed a job and quickly became emersed in the advertising field as a Developer/Designer. In the next 7 years I worked hard to grow my career and got my hands on every project I could. I started at Pittsburghs largest advertising  firm, Brunner. I learned how fast the industry moved and how quickly new trends needed to be learned and implemented on the next project.
            </p>
            <p> 
                After working at Brunner for 4 years I went to Agency 1903, another agency but much much smaller. I went from 150 people to just 10. This was another great job with a whole new experience. I had to where many hats and quickly had to learn to grow professionally but not just with design and development. I was sitting in on meeting talking with clients and giving demos of what we can do and offer. Lets just say my this job kept me very busy. After agency 1903 I landed a job at PNC Bank where I spent 6 months working on their user experience team and help launch their current website.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is where my career took an unexpected turn. Before moving to Salt Lake City I lived in Albany, New Yory for about a year and a half. I had trouble finding a design/dev job that fitted what I was looking for and took a job in the renewable energy field. I can't lie it was a breath of fresh air being away from the desk and running around houses and rooftops. I was installing residential Solar Sytems for Solar City/Tesla. I always saw this as a short term job but it was new and exciting for the time being and I enjoyed it. After some time in Albany I quickly realized I wanted to try SLC and lucky enough was able to tranfer with my current solar job.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I started Solar I knew it would be a temporary job but 1 year turned into 2.5. I quickly realized how long I have been out of the dev/design environment and while looking at jobs trying to break back in I felt lost. I tried to learn and catch back up through online tutorials but I had trouble learning through videos, trying to come up with my own cirriculum and simply putting in the time. Thats how I ended up here. When I moved to Utah I caught wind of the coding bootcamps and starting researching them to see if they could help me get to where I need to be. After reading what each had to offer and hundreds of reviews I chose DevPoint Labs.
