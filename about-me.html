                My name is Jonathon Esack. I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Growing up I have always loved to be outside. While other kids were inside playing video games I was outside riding my bike/dirt bike, playing basketball, or getting dirty any other way I could. As I grew up I was obsessed with BMX, skateboarding and basketball. They consumed all of my time and kept me outside all day everyday. In high school I was introduced to Photoshop and quickly realized that I had a passion for the new medium and spent my next 4 year learning it ins and outs. When it came time for college I wanted to expend that horizon since the Graphic Design field was so flooded. I enrolled at The Art Institute of Pittsburgh pursuing a degree in Interactive Media and Design. I chose this because you not only learned Design but they started you off in learning my first few languages (HTML, CSS, Actionscript) but we'll get to know more about that 
                on the "Why I'm Here" page.

                As I mentioned I was born and raised in Pittburgh. I moved to Salt lake City last year and have loved every minute of it. I love a city where you drive drive in any direction and quickly be away from the the madness the city can create and be surrounded by nature. I still love being outside when not working and that hasnt changed at all. With most of my free time you can find me in one of the canyons either snowboarding or climbing and taking in what nature has to offer. In fact this is what I do with all of my free time. If it isnt snowing I am packing my car and seeking my next climbing adventure whether locally or in another state.
